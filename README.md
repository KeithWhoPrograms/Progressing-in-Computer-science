# Progressing-in-Computer-science
An enduring chronicle of my growth and progress in varying computer science disciplines.

2/27/21 I was tasked with submitting a project from CS-210, and I honestly couldn't think of one. That in mind, overall, I'm understanding C++ more completely sooner than I was expecting to; and I feel ready to move on to more advanced concepts within the language, along with more advanced applications of what I already know. 

"Where and how could I enhance my code?"
    This is my first assignment through Github, and I know already how quickly a skill set can expand, so I'm actually glad that I can't really say how I might look back on past code, only to say that I look forward to the day that I do come back to those old assignments and feel that they're now quaint compared to what I can do by that point.
   
I found alot of the coding assignments "challenging" early on, with those early lessons and the way "zybooks" presents the material not really being condusive to learning. It wasn't until I went out, on my own and learned in C++ the things that I already know how to do in Basic, from there, things really turned around. Transferable skills, not to boisterous, have to be the things I went out and picked up on my own; any individual program I put in here whether I'm in school or beyond that point, was/will be built on that foundation.

04/21/21 The Gaming Room tasked me with plotting the development and strategy behind how to best port their game "Draw it or Lose it" to other platforms. Specifically, the only software requirement was to maintain the integrity of the base game in it's various potential ports, the game itself, marketed as a sort of reimagined Pictionary, relies on the displaying of a database of high-quality images.

I feel that I was at my best composing the document throughout, wording and presenting things aren't really an issue for me, though I didn't feel familiar enough with some of the potential platforms to be speaking on them, as my school's somewhat hands-off approach to education leaves a good bit to be desired and these concepts are left feeling less than fully explored.

I would say being made to plot out my code or a project's development has helped me visualize what I want to do on a finer level than I anticipated. Furthermore, at this point I wouldn't choose to revise any part of what I've done as I haven't learned anything new or different enough to go about fine tuning it from/with, though I can imagine a time when I could maybe write the code in a more optimized fashion, or maybe even a simpler method of performing the same processes.

From experience I felt that I could intuit the user's experience and that perspective was a factor in my ultimate decision to go with Windows PCs for the port. These days, not many programs are designed to be this "reliant" on images for the gameplay, so I don't believe much could carry over, and to come back to this type of project in the future, I would expect that I could whip that one together even easier because of this experience.

8/22/21 By making sure that this information was first clearly presented to me before then bringing it to the team for inclusion in the application. Since 'user stories' are descriptions from the same person requesting the work, theoretically this approach helps to prevent miscommunication, between the two parties.

I begin the project with all required design materials re-assembled personally from the original materials and the disparate sources that it's compiled from, this way, it's "my" program before I get started, made my way but composed of what someone else has contracted me to produce. When working with a team, scrum meetings feel the most necessary, especially if there is no prior relationship between the team members, it'll help establish a rapport and with that trust, a more effective team.

Communication, a team that can't rely on each other isn't a team, they're a group of individuals who can much more easily fail from trying to take on too much essentially alone.
