# Progressing-in-Computer-science
An enduring chronicle of my growth and progress in varying computer science disciplines.

2/27/21 I was tasked with submitting a project from CS-210, and I honestly couldn't think of one. That in mind, overall, I'm understanding C++ more completely sooner than I was expecting to; and I feel ready to move on to more advanced concepts within the language, along with more advanced applications of what I already know. 

"Where and how could I enhance my code?"
    This is my first assignment through Github, and I know already how quickly a skill set can expand, so I'm actually glad that I can't really say how I might look back on past code, only to say that I look forward to the day that I do come back to those old assignments and feel that they're now quaint compared to what I can do by that point.
   
I found alot of the coding assignments "challenging" early on, with those early lessons and the way "zybooks" presents the material not really being condusive to learning. It wasn't until I went out, on my own and learned in C++ the things that I already know how to do in Basic, from there, things really turned around. Transferable skills, not to boisterous, have to be the things I went out and picked up on my own; any individual program I put in here whether I'm in school or beyond that point, was/will be built on that foundation.
